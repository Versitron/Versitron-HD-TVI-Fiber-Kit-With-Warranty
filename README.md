## Fiber Optic vs Ethernet CCTV

**Understanding the key differences between fiber-optic and Ethernet CCTV transmission:**

- **Distance:**  
  - *Fiber optic* extends video far beyond Ethernet limits ideal for large campuses or long runs.  
  - *Ethernet* (copper) is typically limited to ~100 m without extenders.  
- **Interference Immunity:**  
  - *Fiber* is immune to EMI/RFI and electrical noise.  
  - *Ethernet copper* can be affected in electrically noisy environments.  
- **Bandwidth & Performance:**  
  - *Fiber* supports higher bandwidths and future scalability.  
  - *Ethernet* is common and cost-effective for shorter runs.  
- **Installation Considerations:**  
  - *Fiber* requires proper terminations and considerations for outdoor routes.  
  - *Ethernet* is simpler to deploy but limited in range and interference resistance.  

Use the right technology depending on distance, environment, and performance requirements.
